## Fish shell completions for IDLEChain Project
This folder has basic Fish completions for `idlechaind`, `idlechain-wallet-cli`, and `idlechain-wallet-rpc`. To use them, put those files (or symlink them) inside `~/.config/fish/completions/` or wherever your Fish completion files are (see [https://fishshell.com/docs/current/completions.html#where-to-put-completions](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/completions.html#where-to-put-completions))
